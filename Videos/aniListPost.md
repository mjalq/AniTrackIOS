Hi everyone,
I wanted to share with everyone the app that I've been working on for a year now that was released six months ago and updated consistently with major features after release.

__AniTrack__

Just to set some expectations, I made this app with some goals in mind, mainly the ability to do most core things on the website on the app, and to create features I wished existed on the AniList website. I also use the app daily, so bugs get squashed as soon as they're found.
___

___Core features that the app currently supports:___
- Logging in (Duh).
- Managing user anime & manga lists.
- Sorting your lists by last updated, user score, a-z, airing first, or release date.
- Search through your list.
- View your lists while not connected to the internet.
- Notifications for airing anime episodes,
- Background list sync to keep your list up to date with the website.
- Viewing anime & manga entries including their info, description, characters, relations, and similar entries.
- Explore, searching for anime & manga by title, trending page, popular this season, upcoming, and more.
- Viewing and searching for users, characters, and staff.
- AniList user page includes their profile pic, banner image, about, stats, and their favorite anime, manga, characters, and staff.
- Character description including favorite count and voice actors for said character.
- Voice actor description including favorite count and characters voiced.
- Searching using genre, tag, or year, and including sorting options as well.
- Favoriting anime, manga, characters, and staff members.
- Light & Dark theme.
- Sharing entries and opening their respective AniList page in app. 
- Viewing logged in user stats, including total anime watched and the average score, hours wasted on anime, and more!
- Updating user settings in app like changing title style, adult filter, and score format.
- Opening AniList links in app just by pasting the link into any search bar.
- Enlarge anime & manga posters by tapping on them.
- Reorder list sections.
- Almost every major app setting is modifiable in settings. 
- Proper support for different screen sizes for iPads and MacOS.
- And probably much more that I missed.

___Now onto the most exciting stuff.___

- Search History: entries searched that are not in the user's list are saved in the search page just in case you want to revisit them later. The number of entries kept can be changed in settings.

- Related List: This is a big one. The related list occupies the home tab of the app and displays entries that you would want to know about to complete your Anime list, This is very useful in two cases, 
-- Case A, you missed some side stories or a sequel to an anime you completed in your list some time ago, it will appear on this list to help you catch up.
--Case B, you are up to date with most entries in your list and a new season of Re:Zero (plz I beg) gets announced and you missed the announcement, it will automatically appear in your related list.

- Enlarged image poster AI upscaling: Let's say you wanted to view an anime poster in full screen to enjoy the artwork, you click on the image poster to enlarge it, but to your shock you find that the best available image is in 480p. Fear not if you have this setting ON (it's on by default) in a split second the image will be upscaled to 4K seamlessly.

Some notes to keep in mind, the app is completely free, doesn't collect any user data at all, has no in-app purchases, and probably won't in the future as its mainly a personal passion project. Also feel free to email me using the email in app for feedback and feature suggestions or just comment down below. 

Latest update as of this post v1.4.2
App link: https://apps.apple.com/app/anitrack/id1597365390


Hope you give the app a chance.
Thanks for reading.
